Kabani is not for ever going to suffer in silence –
I suppose their witness have the right to
do whatever they want to –
Pembi’s child can burst out at the top of its voice
Pandurangan can leave his master;
Thema can cut off her landlord’s head; and
Marachathan can follow the example of his ‘Peruman’.
